\description{
The gene set module is for adding a gene set filter to displays. A
\code{\link[shiny]{selectizeInput}} is used for performance reasons, 
providing an autocomplete field for selecting from a list that could stretch 
to thousands of entries. This would be difficult to do client-side using a 
standard select field.
