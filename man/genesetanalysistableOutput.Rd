\description{
This module displays gene set analysis tables stored as a list in the 
\code{gene_set_analyses} slot of an \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment}.
}
\details{
The \code{gene_set_analyses} slot must be keyed first by the name of the 
assay to which it pertains, and second by the gene set type (e.g. 'KEGG'). 
The containing \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment} must have a populated
\code{gene_sets} slot, keyed first by metadata column used to define the 
gene sets and secondly by the gene set type.

The module is based on the output of roast() from \code{limma}, but it's 
fairly generic, and assumes only the presence of a 'p value' and 'FDR' 
column, so the output of other methods should be easily adapted to suit.
