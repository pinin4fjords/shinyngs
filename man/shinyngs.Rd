\title{Interactive downstream analysis with ShinyNGS.}
\description{
shinyngs is a package for downstream visualisation of data stored in 
\code{SummarizedExperiment}-like objects, produced as a end-point of 
bioinformatics analysis workflows.
}
\details{
What follows is technical documentation for the package, use 
\code{vignette('shinyngs')} to get more user-friendly information on package 
usage.
}
\section{Principal software dependencies}{
 This package makes use of many 
  packages, and is indebted to their developers. 
  \href{http://shiny.rstudio.com/}{Shiny} provides the overall framework that
  made the current work possible, and \href{https://plot.ly/}{Plotly} has
  been key to making the included visualisations as dynamic and useful as
  they are.
  
  Plotly's R interface has changed markedly between versions, and 
  \code{shinyngs} is currently dependent on a version later than the (now 
  somewhat old) version on CRAN. This should therefore be installed from 
  GitHub: \code{devtools::install_github('ropensci/plotly', 
  upgrade_dependencies = FALSE)}.
}

\section{Input data structure}{
 \code{shinyngs} defines two new data 
  structures. The first, \code{\link{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment}} simply
  takes SummarizedExperiment, and adds some slots to allow extra description 
  around experiments. These extra slots are not compulsory, however, and a 
  simple SummarizedExperiment can be converted directly into an 
  \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment}:
  
  \preformatted{ ese <- as(airway, 'ExploratorySummarizedExperiment') }
  
  Because a single \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment} is limited to one 
  set of features, \code{\link{ExploratorySummarizedExperimentList}} was 
  devised to allow incorporation of other feature sets. For example, we might
  want to visualise expression in terms of both transcripts and genes. 
  \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperimentList} is just a list of 
  \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment}s, with some additonal slots 
  pertaining to a study as a whole.
  
  To use \code{shinyngs}, data is assumed to be in these formats. I'm not 
  terribly happy with the structure of some of the slots in these objects, 
  and they may be open to 'improvement' in the future.
  
  \subsection{Example data}{An example based on the Zhang et al study of 
  neurons and glia (http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/36/11929.long) is 
  included in the package, and can be picked apart to further understand the 
  data structure.}
}

\section{Shiny modules}{
 The functionality of \code{shinyngs} revolves around 
  \href{http://shiny.rstudio.com/}{Shiny}'s concept of modules 
  (\url{http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html}), so this bears some 
  explanation.
  
  Modules allow essentially object-oriented coding for Shiny, and the hiving 
  of of code into namespaces such that it can be re-used in different parts 
  of an application without interfering with itself. \code{shinyngs} has many
  modules that provide various functionalities.
  
  \subsection{Components}{Each module will have server and UI functions that
  provide processing and UI functionality respectively. For example, the
  \code{dendro} module, which provides sample clustering dengrograms, has
  \code{\link{dendroInput}}, which provides user interface components to
  determine clustering method etc, and \code{\link{dendro}}, which parses
  those inputs and calls the appropriate functions to generate a dendrogram.
  \code{\link{dendroOutput}} provides elements that display the outputs when
  they're ready. These functions are all present in dendro.R.}
  
  \subsection{Usage}{Any application seeking to create dendrograms need only 
  call \code{\link{dendroInput}} \code{\link{dendroOutput}} in the parts of 
  their application where inputs and outputs should appear, and then use 
  \code{\link[shiny]{callModule}} (again using the same ID) to activate them.
  
  \preformatted{
  dendroInput(ns('dendro'), eselist)
  dendroOutput(ns('dendro'))
  callModule(dendro, 'dendro', eselist) }}
  
  These module functions are not currently exported, not currenlty being 
  intended for use outside \code{shinyngs}. This may change.
}

\section{Main functions}{

  
  Usage of modules defined in \code{shinyngs} is envisaged to be 
  predominantly via \code{\link{prepareApp}}. For most modules, this passes 
  its arguments to \code{\link{simpleApp}}, which very simply takes its 
  \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperimentList} and a module name, and attempts 
  to call the UI and server functions of that module, creating a simple 
  sidebar layout. Taking our dendro app and using the \code{airway} example 
  data:
  
  \preformatted{
  data(airway, package = 'airway')
  ese <- as(airway, 'ExploratorySummarizedExperiment')
  eselist <- ExploratorySummarizedExperimentList(ese)
  app <- prepareApp('heatmap',eselist)}
  
  Other apps, for example \code{\link{rnaseq}} require more complex layouts 
  and don't use \code{simpleApp}.
  
  \code{prepareApp} returns list with UI and server applications components. 
  Shiny's \code{\link[shiny]{shinyApp}} must then be called to actually run 
  the app: \code{shiny::shinyApp(ui = app$ui, server = app$server)}.
}

\section{Deploying to a shiny server}{

  
  Assuming a \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperimentList} has been serialised
  with \code{link[base]{saveRDS}}, the Shiny app can be deployed to a server
  in a script called 'app.R' with content like this:
  
  \preformatted{
  library(shinyngs)
  mydata <- readRDS('data.rds') app <- prepareApp('rnaseq', mydata)
  shiny::shinyApp(app$ui, app$server)}
}

\section{Module list}{


There are three varieties of module in \code{shinyngs}. Top-level modules
such as \code{rnaseq} provide complex data mining tools pulling together a
number of other modules. Some of those sub-modules can also be called
stand-alone to make heatmaps or dendrograms, for example. Other modules just
provide small components that don't make sense in isolation. This is the full
set at the time of writing:

\subsection{Top-level}{\describe{\item{rnaseq}{Pull together PCA analysis,
heat maps, dendgrograms, volcano plots, gene sets etc to make a comprehensive
data mining tool.} \item{chipseq}{Currenlty a near clone of \code{rnaseq}, to
be optimised for ChIP-seq in due course.} }}

\subsection{Stand-alone}{

These modules can also be called directly with \code{\link{prepareApp}}:

\describe{ \item{assaydatatable}{Provide access to asay matrices of input 
object} \item{boxplot}{Make quartile/ boxplots} \item{dendro}{Make 
sample-clustering dendgrograms.} \item{dexseqplot}{Differential exon usage 
plot (where relevant slot populated)} \item{dexseqtable}{Differential exon 
usage table (where relevant slot populated)} 
\item{differentialtable}{Differential table showing summarised group values 
and fold changes etc (where contrasts slot is populated).} 
\item{experimentaltable}{Display colData() output from selected 
\code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment}} \item{foldchangeplot}{Plot mean 
values of one condition against another (where contrasts slot is populated)} 
\item{gene}{Show expression plots and other available data for selected 
features} \item{genesetanalysistable}{Display content of the 
\code{gene_set_analyses} slot for the selected 
\code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment}} \item{genesetbarcodeplot}{Make a 
barcode plot using selected data and \code{limma}'s 
\code{\link[limma]{barcodeplot}}} \item{heatmap}{Build heatmaps from selected
matrix data. By default this is an expression matrix, but it can also be 
sample vs sample correlation heatmaps or PCA vs covariate association 
heatmaps.} \item{maplot}{Uses the \code{scatterplot} module to plot mean 
expression vs fold change} \item{pca}{Plots 2D or 3D PCA and loading plots 
based on selected matrix data, using the \code{scatterplot} module} 
\item{readreports}{Makes bar plots and tables of read counts data where 
provided in the \code{read_reports} slot of an 
\code{ExploratorySummarizedExperimentList}} \item{rowmetatable}{Displays data
from the metadata slot of a \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment} object 
(accessed via \code{mcols})} \item{volcanoplot}{Uses the \code{scatterplot} 
module to plot fold change vs p value (where necessary slots are populated}}}

\subsection{Component-only}{These modules are only valid as components of
applications created by other modules:

\describe{ \item{barplot}{Used by readreports, for example. Requires reactive
providing input data} \item{contrasts}{Provides data on sample group 
comparisons, using the \code{contrasts} slot of the input object (where 
available)} \item{geneselect}{Provides selection filters for assay matrix 
rows. Used mainly by the \code{selectmatrix} module} 
\item{genesetselect}{Uses 
\href{http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/}{Selectize} to provide an 
autocomplete field to select from available gene sets (where provided in the 
\code{gene_sets} slot)} \item{groupby}{Provides a UI element to choose from 
the \code{group_vars} in a SummarizedExperment. Useful for coloring in a PCA 
etc} \item{labelselectfield}{This module provides an input which allows 
filtering on the basis of row IDs, labels, or other data in the metadata slot
of an \code{ExploratorySummarizedExperiment}} \item{modal}{uses modals from 
\href{https://ebailey78.github.io/shinyBS/}{shinyBS} to create overlaid text 
for the current panel which displays when a link is clicked} 
\item{plotdownload}{Provides a download button for displayed plots} 
\item{sampleselect}{Allows a subset of columns to be selected from the 
selected assay matrix} \item{scatterplot}{A generic module for producing 
scatter plots using Plotly's \code{\link[plotly]{plot_ly}} method. Used by 
multiple other modules, including \code{foldchangeplot} and 
\code{volcanoplot}} \item{scatterplotcontrols}{A set of controls for scatter 
plots. Separation of controls in this module allows them to be used in 
multiple scatter plot instances. For example, both PCA and loading plots can 
be run off the same set of controls} \item{selectmatrix}{Provides 
functionality central to \code{shinyngs}. Uses filtes on experiment and 
assay, along with \code{sampleselect} and \code{geneselect}, to select parts 
of input matrices for use by most other \code{shinyngs} modules} 
\item{simpletable}{A useful generic module that takes a reactive which 
returns a matrix, and both displays that table and produces a download 
button} \item{summarizematrix}{Module which takes a matrix and a factor which
groups columns, and summarises by a supplied method, mean by default} }}
